# Weather App

A new Weather App that built in Flutter.

Bloc was used as a state management solution.

Used 'equatable' package to compare States and Events.

Used 'flutter_svg' to be able to show SVGs.

Used 'flutter_spinkit' for the Loading Spinner.

And Finally, used some Illustrations From unDraw.
